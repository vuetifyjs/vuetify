#
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# <type> can be
#    feat     (new feature)
#    fix      (bug fix)
#    docs     (documentation only)
#    refactor (refactoring production code)
#    style    (formatting, missing semicolons, etc. no code change)
#    test     (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)
#    chore    (updating npm scripts etc. no production code change)
#    revert   (revert a commit
#              <subject> must be the reverted commit's title
#              <description> must contain "This reverts commit <hash>.")
#
# Remember to
#    Not capitalize the subject line
#    Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#    Do not end the subject line with a period
#    Separate subject from body with a blank line (comments don't count)
#    Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#
# If you can't summarize your changes in a single line, they should
# probably be split into multiple commits
