# Vuetify Contributing Guide
Hello and thank you for your interest in helping make Vuetify better. Please take a few moments to review the following guidelines:

## IMPORTANT INFORMATION
* A detailed guide on how to [develop in Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/getting-started/contributing/) is located in the documentation.
* For general questions, please join [our Discord Community](https://community.vuetifyjs.com/).

## Reporting Issues
* Issues **not** created with https://issues.vuetifyjs.com/ will be immediately closed.
* The issue list of this repo is **exclusively** for Bug Reports and Feature Requests.
* Bug reproductions should be as **concise** as possible.
* **Search** for your issue, it _may_ have been answered.
* See if the error is **reproduceable** with the latest version.
* If reproduceable, please provide a [Codepen](https://template.vuetifyjs.com) or public repository that can be cloned to produce the expected behavior. It is preferred that you create an initial commit with no changes first, then another one that will cause the issue. 
* **Never** comment "+1" or "me too!" on issues without leaving additional information, use the :+1: button in the top right instead.

## Pull Requests
* Always work on a new branch. Making changes on your fork's `dev` or `master` branch can cause problems. (See [The beginner's guide to contributing to a GitHub project](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/))
* Bug fixes should be submitted to the `master` branch.
* New features and breaking changes should be submitted to the `dev` branch.
* Use a descriptive title no more than 64 characters long. This will be used as the commit message when your PR is merged. 
* For changes and feature requests, please include an example of what you are trying to solve and an example of the markup. It is preferred that you create an issue first however, as that will allow the team to review your proposal before you start. 
* Please reference the issue # that the PR resolves, something like `Fixes #1234` or `Resolves #6458` (See [closing issues using keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/))
