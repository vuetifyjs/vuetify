# Sponsor Vuetify development

Vuetify is an [MIT licensed](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) open-source project that's completely free to use. It is actively maintained by [John](https://github.com/johnleider) and [Heather](https://github.com/heatherleider) Leider as a full-time job. In addition, a Core team of open-source contributors help maintain and guide the future of the framework. The time and dedication it takes to maintain the core framework and ecosystem packages is substantial. You can support Vuetify’s open-source project by becoming a backer through one of the following methods:

## One-time donations

One-time donations can be made through [PayPal](https://paypal.me/vuetify).

## Recurring Pledges

Recurring pledges come with **exclusive** perks such as priority GitHub issues, application auditing, and having your logo placed on this website.

- [Become a backer or sponsor via GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/johnleider) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/vuetify) (goes directly to Vuetify to support John and Heather).
- [Become a backer or sponsor through Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/vuetify) (a transparent fund for supporting the development and maintenance of Vuetify).
