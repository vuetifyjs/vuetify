<PromotedEntry />

## Overview

Vuetify is an open-source project that is free to use. It is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/blob/master/LICENSE.md), one of the most permissive and flexible open source licenses available.

## What is the MIT License?

The MIT License is one of the most widely used licenses in the open-source community, known for its simplicity and permissiveness. This license grants users significant freedom in how they use, modify, and distribute software. Here are its key features and what they mean for Vuetify users:

- **Freedom to Use**: The MIT License allows you to use Vuetify for any purpose - whether it's a private hobby project, a high-scale commercial application, or a public service. This level of freedom ensures that Vuetify is accessible to everyone, regardless of their project's nature or scale.
- **Freedom to Modify**: Flexibility is at the core of Vuetify, and the MIT License extends this principle. You have the freedom to tweak, customize, and modify Vuetify to suit your project's unique requirements. This feature is particularly beneficial for developers looking to tailor their UI/UX without constraints.
- **Freedom to Distribute**: The license not only allows you to use and modify Vuetify but also to distribute your version of it. Whether you're distributing your Vuetify-based project openly or commercially, the MIT License supports your endeavors. This aspect is crucial for fostering a culture of sharing and innovation in the developer community.
- **No Warranty**: Please note that Vuetify is provided "as is", without any warranty of any kind. This is a standard clause in open-source licenses, emphasizing that users should test and evaluate the software in their specific contexts. While there's no formal warranty, the Vuetify team is committed to delivering a high-quality, robust framework, continuously working to improve its reliability and functionality.

The MIT License's simplicity and breadth make it an ideal choice for Vuetify, aligning with our commitment to open-source values and community-driven development.

## Why MIT License for Vuetify?

Choosing the MIT License for Vuetify was a deliberate decision to align with our core values of openness, simplicity, and community collaboration. Hereâ€™s why this license is the perfect fit for Vuetify:

- **Simplicity and Permissiveness**: The MIT License is renowned for its simplicity and clarity. It doesn't impose complex restrictions, making it straightforward for developers to use Vuetify in various projects. Whether you're building a small personal project or a large-scale commercial application, the MIT License keeps things simple and unrestricted.
- **Broad Compatibility**: One of Vuetify's strengths is its compatibility with a wide range of other tools and libraries. The MIT License is known for its broad compatibility with other open-source licenses. This compatibility makes it easier for developers to integrate Vuetify with other software, fostering a more vibrant and versatile ecosystem.
- **Encourages Open Source Contribution**: Vuetify thrives on community contributions. The permissive nature of the MIT License encourages developers from around the world to contribute to Vuetify, enhancing its features and functionality. This collaborative spirit has been pivotal in shaping Vuetify into the robust and versatile framework it is today.

By adopting the MIT License, Vuetify remains committed to promoting innovation, collaboration, and freedom in software development. We believe this approach not only benefits Vuetify but also the broader open-source community.
