Released in July 2019, Vuetify 2 marked a critical turning point in Vuetify's growth, establishing it as a prominent Vue UI library. Countless developers and organizations built remarkable applications with Vuetify 2, expanding its community and impact significantly.

However, simultaneously supporting multiple major versions isn't feasible for our team in the long term. Vuetify 3, launched in October 2022, has reached maturity, offering enhanced capabilities and substantial improvements that demand our full attention and resources.

Effective January 25th, 2025, Vuetify 2 officially reached End of Life (EOL). While this means no further updates, bug fixes, or feature additions will be provided, Vuetify 2 remains accessible via established distribution channels, including CDNs, package managers, and GitHub.

For new projects, Vuetify 3 is the recommended choice, and we encourage teams still using Vuetify 2 to plan their migration as soon as possible.

## What if You're Still Using Vuetify 2?

We understand migration isn't always straightforward or immediately achievable. If you're currently unable to transition, here are practical steps to manage your Vuetify 2 projects post-EOL:

### Consider HeroDevs Extended LTS Support

HeroDevs offers an Extended Long-Term Support (LTS) service specifically for Vuetify 2. This service includes critical security updates, bug fixes, and compatibility patches, ensuring your application remains secure and functional beyond the official EOL date. HeroDevs's team of experts can provide tailored support to meet your project's unique needs, allowing you to maintain compliance and operational stability while planning your migration to Vuetify 3.

For more information, visit [HeroDevs Extended LTS](https://www.herodevs.com/support/vuetify-nes?utm_source=partnership&utm_medium=partnership&utm_campaign=partnership&utm_id=vuetify2) and explore how their services can benefit your project.

### Upgrade to the Latest Vuetify 2.x Release

Ensure you're on the latest stable release (Vuetify 2.7.x). This final version aligns more closely with Vuetify 3, providing a smoother pathway for future migration efforts and acting as a reliable foundation for continued extended support.

### Upgrade to the Latest Vuetify 3 Release

If possible, consider upgrading directly to Vuetify 3. While this transition may require additional effort, Vuetify 3 offers numerous benefits, including improved performance, enhanced features, and a more streamlined development experience. Our [Upgrade Guide](https://vuetifyjs.com/getting-started/upgrade-guide/) provides detailed instructions and best practices for migrating from Vuetify 2 to Vuetify 3.

### Communicate Clearly with Stakeholders

If migration or extended support isn't currently possible, transparent communication is key. Clearly outline your post-EOL strategy to your stakeholders, clients, and internal compliance teams. It's essential to inform them how your team will proactively handle potential vulnerabilities and maintain operational stability.

Vuetify 2 has consistently demonstrated strong security practices, but vulnerabilities can still emerge through dependencies or environmental changes. Monitoring services such as OpenCVE and Snyk can keep you promptly informed about any security risks.

While Vuetify 2 continues to provide a stable development experience, prioritizing migration or implementing robust support plans will ensure the long-term success and security of your applications.
