## Vuetify Partners with HeroDevs to Provide Long-Term Support for Vuetify 2

Vuetify is excited to announce a partnership with HeroDevs to provide extended long-term support for Vuetify 2 users through **Vue 2 NES + Essentials**, a secure drop-in replacement.

[Vuetify 2 reached end-of-life (EOL) on January 23, 2025](/introduction/long-term-support/), meaning it no longer receives official updates. Applications still relying on Vuetify 2 are now at risk of security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and compatibility challenges.

For teams that haven’t yet migrated to Vuetify 3, whether due to project constraints, long-term maintenance needs, or regulatory requirements, HeroDevs offers Vue 2 NES + Essentials—a solution designed to keep applications secure and up to date without requiring an immediate migration.

“I am glad to partner with HeroDevs to give Vuetify 2 users and teams a secure solution. I know that HeroDevs teams are reactive and well-trained, giving us more focus on the future of Vuetify.”
<br><span class="text-caption font-weight-bold">— John Leider, Creator of Vuetify</span> { .blockquote .border-s-lg }

### Why This Partnership Matters

Vuetify 2 has been widely adopted across industries, helping developers build high-quality, responsive applications. While many teams have transitioned to Vuetify 3, not all applications can be migrated immediately. Some businesses require long-term stability, regulatory compliance, or compatibility with existing systems, making an immediate upgrade difficult.

With **HeroDevs' Vue 2 NES + Essentials**, organizations can continue using Vuetify 2 while receiving:

- ✅ **Security patches** for known vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Compliance updates** to meet regulatory standards
- ✅ **Compatibility fixes** to maintain stability in modern environments

### Supporting the Vuetify Community

While Vuetify is focused on the future with Vuetify 3 and beyond, we recognize the importance of providing a secure option for teams that still rely on Vuetify 2. Partnering with HeroDevs ensures that these users have a reliable, long-term solution to keep their applications secure.
