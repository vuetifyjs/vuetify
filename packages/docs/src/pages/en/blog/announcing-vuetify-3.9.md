## Component promotions

The following components have been promoted to the core framework from labs and offer a clean experience and are easy to use.

### VTreeview

The [v-treeview](https://vuetifyjs.com/components/treeview/) component has moved from Labs to the Core framework in v3.9. It's designed for displaying hierarchical data in a tree structure and supports all of the standard Vuetify component variant props.

![VTreeview component](/api/v1/files/blog/v3.9/v-treeview-component.png){ height=400 }

The component now exposes **depth**, **path**, and **index** in slots, giving you more control over item rendering. It also supports the new **item-type** prop for better TypeScript integration and includes an **indent-lines** prop for visual connection lines between parent and child nodes.

**Details:**
- [Documentation](https://vuetifyjs.com/components/treeview/)
- [PR#19833](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/pull/19833)

### VTimePicker

The [v-time-picker](https://vuetifyjs.com/components/time-pickers/) component has moved from Labs to the Core framework in v3.9. This component provides an intuitive interface for time selection that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

![VTimePicker component](/api/v1/files/blog/v3.9/v-time-picker-component.png){ height=300 }

The component has been streamlined by removing the **ampmInTitle** prop and includes auto-width functionality for better responsive design.

**Details:**
- [Documentation](https://vuetifyjs.com/components/time-pickers/)
- [PR#21595](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/pull/21595)

## Theme system enhancements

v3.9 introduces revolutionary improvements to the theme system, including automatic system preference detection and enhanced programmatic control.

### System theme

The new **system** theme automatically respects your users' operating system preferences for light or dark mode. This eliminates the need for manual theme switching logic in most applications.

![System theme example](/api/v1/files/blog/v3.9/system-theme-example.png){ height=300 }

When using the system theme, Vuetify automatically detects changes to the user's system preferences and updates the application theme accordingly.

**Details:** [PR#21244](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/pull/21244)

### Theme control functions

New **change**, **toggle**, and **cycle** functions provide powerful programmatic theme control. These functions make it easy to implement custom theme switching interfaces and respond to user interactions.

![Theme control functions](/api/v1/files/blog/v3.9/theme-control-functions.png){ height=300 }

**Details:** [PR#21224](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/pull/21224)

### Unimportant class option

The new **unimportant** option generates theme classes without `!important` declarations, making it easier to override styles with custom CSS or integrate with other frameworks.

![Unimportant class option](/api/v1/files/blog/v3.9/unimportant-class-option.png){ height=300 }

**Details:** [Commit 3190331](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/commit/3190331)

## Developer experience improvements

v3.9 places significant emphasis on improving the developer experience with new composables and enhanced APIs.

### useHotkey composable

The new **useHotkey** composable provides a declarative approach to keyboard event handling with built-in accessibility features and cross-platform compatibility.

```ts
import { useHotkey } from 'vuetify'

export default {
  setup() {
    // Simple hotkey binding
    useHotkey('ctrl+s', () => {
      console.log('Save triggered!')
      // Your save logic here
    })

    // Multiple key combinations
    useHotkey(['ctrl+k', 'cmd+k'], () => {
      // Open command palette
      openCommandPalette()
    })

    // Conditional hotkeys with options
    useHotkey('escape', closeModal, {
      enabled: () => modalOpen.value,
      preventDefault: true
    })

    return {}
  }
}
```

The composable automatically handles event cleanup, cross-platform key mapping, and conflict prevention.

**Details:** [PR#21598](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/pull/21598)

### Enhanced component APIs

Multiple components receive API improvements including **VDataTable** fixed column positioning, **VSelect** item-type support, and enhanced **VDatePicker** slot exposure.

![Enhanced component APIs](/api/v1/files/blog/v3.9/enhanced-component-apis.png){ height=300 }

These improvements focus on consistency, flexibility, and developer ergonomics across the component library.

## Other updates

Some other updates in v3.9 involve quality of life improvements to existing components and new functionality for common use cases.

### VSelect enhancements

VSelect, VAutocomplete, and VCombobox now support **divider** and **subheader** in items, along with the new **item-type** prop for improved TypeScript integration.

![VSelect enhancements](/api/v1/files/blog/v3.9/v-select-enhancements.png){ height=300 }

**Details:** [PR#21348](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/pull/21348)

### Form input improvements

Multiple form components receive enhancements including **VNumberInput** custom decimal separators, **VBadge** width and height props, and **VTextarea** update:rows event.

![Form input improvements](/api/v1/files/blog/v3.9/form-input-improvements.png){ height=300 }

**Details:** [PR#21489](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/pull/21489)

## Labs

The latest version of Vuetify also includes new experimental components in Labs, including VHotkey and VMaskInput. These components are in active development and testing.

### VHotkey

The [v-hotkey](https://vuetifyjs.com/components/hotkeys/) component provides visual representations of keyboard shortcuts throughout your application, enhancing user discoverability and creating more intuitive interfaces.

![VHotkey component](/api/v1/files/blog/v3.9/v-hotkey-component.png){ height=300 }

The component automatically renders platform-appropriate keys and integrates seamlessly with the useHotkey composable.

This component is getting close to being ready for production, keep an eye out for it in the next release!

### VMaskInput

The VMaskInput component brings sophisticated input masking capabilities to Vuetify, enabling precise control over user input formatting for phone numbers, credit cards, dates, and custom formats.

```html
<template>
  <v-mask-input
    v-model="phoneNumber"
    mask="(###) ###-####"
    label="Phone Number"
    placeholder="(555) 123-4567"
  />
</template>

<script setup>
  import { VMaskInput } from 'vuetify/labs/VMaskInput'

  const phoneNumber = ref('')
</script>
```

The component supports flexible mask definitions, real-time validation, and customizable behavior for various input scenarios.

### VCalendar improvements

The [v-calendar](https://vuetifyjs.com/components/calendars/) component received improvements to day element handling and adapter integration, including better performance and reactivity through enhanced key management.

![VCalendar improvements](/api/v1/files/blog/v3.9/v-calendar-improvements.png){ height=300 }

We're also experimenting with improved event handling and slot availability for complex calendar implementations.

```ts
import { VCalendar } from 'vuetify/labs/VCalendar'

export default createVuetify({
  components: {
    VCalendar
  }
})
```

This is still in testing so please give us your feedback by dropping a line on our [Discord](https://community.vuetifyjs.com/)
