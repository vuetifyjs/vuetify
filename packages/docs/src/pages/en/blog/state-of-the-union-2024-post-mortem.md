# State of the Union 2024 Post Mortem

Last year, I stood at a crossroads. Balancing the weight of family, a new job, and Vuetify, I realized something had to change. I underestimated how heavy it had become to carry Vuetify forward with dwindling support from the team. I took on a job at Optikka, hoping it would bring stability, but it left me with little energy to dedicate to the framework. I left the [State of the Union](/blog/state-of-the-union-2024) on a positive note, knowing that there would be challenges ahead, but I was hopeful that we would be able to overcome them.

I had this naive hope Kael could run with Vuetify while I got my bearings, but it's not that kind of machine‚Äîit doesn't coast. When he couldn't make it move, it was like a gut check: had we just blown it for everyone who's stuck with us? This isn't just a project‚Äîit's who I am, and watching it stall hurt. I'd been drifting in a haze, probably for months, maybe more, wrestling stuff I didn't name until now. These new team members? They're not here to patch a leak. They're the shove I needed to remember why I started, why Vuetify's still worth every ounce we've got.

## The Shift

In December, I knew I had to breathe life back into Vuetify. That meant confronting my mistakes‚Äîacknowledging that I hadn't done enough to keep the core team motivated and moving; I had been stuck in an era of thinking that wasn't working anymore. For seven years, I searched for team members the same way, expecting different results. Finding team members organically works in the beginning when hype is high, but when the hype dies down, you need to be more proactive.

I needed to change my approach. I needed to find people who were as passionate about Vuetify as I was, but also willing to step up and take ownership. { .blockquote .border-s-lg }

So I posted a job listing, hoping to find that one person who could inject fresh energy into Vuetify. The response was crazy‚Äîover 130 applications poured in (at least I think it's a lot), each one a reminder of how much this community still cares. But as I sifted through them, I kept hitting a wall: one person couldn't carry it all, not anymore. By Day 2, a new question started nagging at me: What if instead of hiring one person, I brought on multiple contributors in focused roles?

That's where it shifted. Some of the sharpest candidates weren't after a full-time gig‚Äîmany only wanted to give five hours a week. What if we shared the load, each person bringing their strengths? I floated it to them, and their excitement lit up the conversations.

On Day 3, everything clicked, and the enthusiasm for what we could accomplish as a team became undeniable. And when I started seeing how well these individuals fit into key areas of the framework‚Äîfrom NUXT, to component development, documentation, scaffolding, and tooling‚Äîit just started making sense.

## Meet the Nine New Core Team Members

This isn't some random lineup‚Äîit's a crew of passionate coders stepping up to shape Vuetify's future. Together, they'll tackle everything from components to docs to ecosystem tools, adding over 50 years of combined Vuetify experience. Here's who they are:

- **Shubham Patlani (Technical Lead)** - Leading the team with nearly a decade of experience, Shubham will be at the helm, managing and organizing core team efforts.
- **Isaias Briones** - Focused on Documentation and the Calendar component.
- **Henry Aviles** - Focused on the Vuetify API, [Vuetify One](https://one.vuetifyjs.com/), and Vuetify MCP.
- **Ishan Subedi** - Focused on all things dates, GitHub issues, and pull requests.
- **Arslan Ahmed** - Focused on GitHub issues, and pull requests.
- **Andrei Elkin** - Focused on [Nuxt integration](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify-loader), [Vuetify Create](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/create), and [Vuetify Loader](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify-loader).
- **JC Puno** - Focused on [Nuxt integration](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify-loader) and SSR support.
- **Abdelouahed Oumoussa** - Focused on [Vuetify Play](https://play.vuetifyjs.com/), [Vuetify Bin](https://bin.vuetifyjs.com/), [Vuetify Awesome](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/awesome), [Issues Generator](https://issues.vuetifyjs.com/), and implementing ecosystem features.
- **Aaron Groenke** - Focused on Labs components and VFeatureDiscovery.

These Vuetify heavy hitters are joining the existing ranks of core team members, including myself, Kael, and a few others. We're not just adding bodies‚Äîwe're stacking the team with talent that's ready to dig in and carry this framework forward together.

## Investing in the Future

How do we pay for this dream team? Glad you asked. The Open Collective's got $6,800 coming in monthly, and we're sitting on just over $16,000. With the new hires, that's six months before we're back to bartering with coffee. So, I threw in $5,000 of my own‚Äîcall it a nudge to see if anyone's paying attention.

If 30 companies matched me, we'd fund Vuetify for years. You're rolling your eyes, I can feel it‚Äîbut picture this: you hit that [Open Collective link](https://opencollective.com/vuetify), and suddenly we're not just a team, we're a movement. I've seen this [community rally before](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/2240).

## Closing: The Road Ahead

I can't thank this community enough‚Äîfor sticking with us, for believing in Vuetify even when I faltered. We've lost some along the way, and I own that, but now it's time to build smarter, together. With this team and your support, we'll hit the precision this next chapter demands. How incredible could that be?

If this stirs you, join us on [Discord](https://community.vuetifyjs.com) or pitch in directly. Companies using Vuetify, let's shape its future together. This has always been about us‚Äîall of us‚Äîand it still is.
