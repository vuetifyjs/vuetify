## Powering Forward

June delivered substantial progress on developer experience enhancements, component stability improvements, and platform ecosystem expansion. Our team focused on shipping major new composables, refining core components, and strengthening the development workflow with significant updates to hotkey management, command palette functionality, and comprehensive bug fixes across the framework.

We also hosted an engaging Q&A session with [me](https://github.com/johnleider/), where our community shared their questions and valuable insights. We were thrilled to connect directly with our users and gather feedback that will help shape the future direction of the framework. Don't worry if you missed this session, we have exciting webinars planned for the coming months as well!

## Spotlight: Vuetify Studio

**Did you know?** [Vuetify Studio](https://studio.vuetifyjs.com/) is our comprehensive development platform that often goes unnoticed by the broader community. Studio provides a complete ecosystem for Vuetify development, including:

* **Interactive Component Playground**: Test and experiment with components in real-time
* **Code Generation Tools**: Quickly prototype layouts and component configurations
* **Collaborative Development**: Share and iterate on designs with team members
* **Integration Testing**: Validate component behavior across different scenarios

## Framework

There are multiple new components in development with some of that functionality reaching Labs this month. Below are some of the highlights.

### VHotkey Component and useHotkey Composable

This month marked a significant milestone with the completion and pre-release of our [VHotkey component](https://dev.vuetifyjs.com/en/components/hotkeys/) and `useHotkey` composable system. After extensive development and iteration, these tools are now available in Labs for testing and feedback as we work toward their stable release.

**VHotkey Component Features:**

* **Inline Mode**: Use the component inline with text and it automatically inherits font size and baseline styling
* **New Variants**: Introduction of the Combined Variant that displays hotkeys in a Chip with Label format
* **Consolidated Parser**: VHotkey and useHotkey now share the same parsing logic and key alias mapping for consistent behavior
* **Platform Awareness**: New `platform` prop allows forcing the component to display Mac vs PC hotkey conventions
* **Enhanced Customization**: Added `prefix` and `postfix` props for better integration flexibility

![Hero image for VHotkey component](https://vuetifyjs.b-cdn.net/docs/images/blog/june-2025-update/hotkeys.png "VHotkey component hero image"){ height=220 }

**useHotkey Composable Features:**

* **Dynamic Options**: Options accept `maybeRefs`, enabling dynamic hotkey configuration changes
* **Shared Logic**: Unified codebase with VHotkey component ensures consistency
* **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed examples and usage patterns available

This functionality serves as a critical building block for the upcoming VCommandPalette component, providing developers with robust keyboard shortcut management that works seamlessly across different platforms and use cases. While currently in Labs, we encourage the community to test these components and provide feedback as we work toward their stable release.

* [useHotkey Composable Documentation](https://dev.vuetifyjs.com/en/features/hotkey/)

### New Component Development

We have several new components in development that we are confident will enhance the Vuetify ecosystem and provide additional functionality for developers.

**VMaskInput**: After vanishing in v2, masking is back in the library with enhanced input capabilities and new features.

## Ecosystem Updates

Multiple advancements were made across the Vuetify ecosystem to improve developer experience and platform capabilities.

### Vuetify Documentation

[Vuetify One subscribers](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/?one=subscribe) can now copy documentation pages as Markdown. This feature allows you to easily extract and reuse documentation content in your projects, enhancing collaboration and knowledge sharing within teams.

![Vuetify documentation copy page as markdown](https://vuetifyjs.b-cdn.net/docs/images/blog/june-2025-update/copy-page-as-markdown.png "Vuetify documentation copy page as markdown"){ height=220 }

All users can now save favorite search results in the Vuetify documentation. Just press `ctrl+k` or `cmd+k` to open the search bar, type your query, and click the star icon next to the search result you want to save. This feature allows you to quickly access frequently used documentation pages, improving your workflow and efficiency.

### Vuetify Bin

Bins now support **locking**. This new functionality prevents unwanted changes to shared code examples, ensuring that your collaborative work remains intact and consistent.

![Vuetify Bin locking functionality](https://vuetifyjs.b-cdn.net/docs/images/blog/june-2025-update/lock-bin.png "Vuetify Bin locking functionality"){ height=250 }

This feature will soon propagate to the [Vuetify Playground](https://play.vuetifyjs.com/) as well as [Vuetify Studio](https://studio.vuetifyjs.com/).

It's also now possible to access Bins saved while having an active Vuetify One subscription.

**Details:**

* [Vuetify Bin](https://bin.vuetifyjs.com/)

## Q&A and Upcoming Webinars

June featured successful community Q&A sessions that provided direct interaction between our core team and the developer community. The feedback and engagement we received were invaluable in shaping our development priorities and understanding real-world usage patterns.

**Missed the Q&A Sessions?** Don't worry! We're planning a comprehensive webinar series launching in July. If you have valuable feedback, suggestions, or questions you'd like to see addressed, keep an eye out for our upcoming webinar announcements. These sessions will provide deep dives into Vuetify best practices, new feature demonstrations, and direct access to core team expertise.

We encourage community members to [share their input](https://community.vuetifyjs.com/) and help us make these educational sessions as valuable as possible for everyone.

## Sneak Peek: Vuetify 0

<AppFigure :src="zerologo" alt="Vuetify 0 logo" width="300" height="auto" class="mx-auto pa-4" title="Vuetify 0 Logo" />

We're excited to share an early glimpse into **Vuetify 0** (internally known as v0), our upcoming entry into the unstyled component and composable ecosystem. Building on our experience with Vuetify's component library, we're developing a new approach that delivers the same functionality and developer experience without built-in styling.

**What This Means**: While unstyled components are certainly part of this initiative, Vuetify 0 represents something much more significant - we're publicly releasing our internal composables and framework building tooling. This includes the foundational utilities, patterns, and architectural components that power Vuetify itself, giving developers access to the same building blocks we use internally to create robust UI frameworks:

```ts
import { useGroup } from '@vuetify/0'
import type { GroupItem, GroupTicket, GroupContext, GroupOptions } from '@vuetify/0'

interface StepItem extends GroupItem {
  title: string
  description?: string
}

interface StepTicket extends GroupTicket {
  step: number
}

interface StepOptions extends Omit<GroupOptions, 'multiple'> {}

interface StepContext extends GroupContext {
  first: () => void
  last: () => void
  next: () => void
  prev: () => void
  step: (count: number) => void
}

const options: StepOptions = {
  itemKey: 'step',
  itemValue: 'value',
}

export function useStep<T extends StepContext> (
  namespace: string,
  options?: StepOptions,
) {
  const [
    useGroupContext,
    provideGroupContext,
    group,
  ] = useGroup<T>(namespace, options)

  function first () { ... }
  function last () { ... }
  function next () { ... }
  function prev () { ... }
  function step (count: number) { ... }

  const context = {
    ...group,
    first,
    last,
    next
    prev,
    step,
  } as T

  return [
    useGroupContext,
    provideGroupContext,
    context,
  ]
}
```

This project is in early development as we explore the best path forward for providing developers with powerful, accessible, and feature-complete building blocks for custom implementations. We're taking time to ensure we deliver genuine value while maintaining the quality standards you expect from Vuetify.

We'll share more details as development progresses and look forward to community feedback on this new direction.
