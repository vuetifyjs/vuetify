## What is Vuetify?

Since its initial release in 2014, [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) has grown to be among the most popular JavaScript frameworks in the world. One of the reasons for this popularity is the wide use of [components](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics.html) which enable developers to create small modules to be used and re-used throughout an application. Vuetify is a collection of pre-made components paired with powerful features such [dynamic themes](/features/theme/), [global defaults](/features/global-configuration/), [application layouts](/features/application-layout/), and more. Its goal is to provide developers with all of the necessary tools to build rich and engaging user experiences.

## Why Vuetify? { id="why-vuetify" }

Vuetify is a powerful Vue Component Framework built from the ground up to be easy to learn and rewarding to master. Our collection of UI components maintain a consistent style throughout your application with enough customization options to meet any use-case.

### It's free { id="its-free" }

Vuetify is an Open Source project available for free under the [MIT licensed](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Additionally, Vuetify's source code is available on GitHub, allowing developers to modify and contribute to its development if they choose to do so.

### Flexible components

Every component in Vuetify is handcrafted under the guise of Google's [Material Design specification](https://material.io/) and comes with hundreds of customization options that fit any style or design; even if it's not Material. Write Vue templates that are as concise or verbose as you want using exclusively or in combination, **props**, **slots**, and **components**.

### Tooling

Vuetify has a large ecosystem of supporting tools that enrich the development experience that range from project creation to design UI kits.
