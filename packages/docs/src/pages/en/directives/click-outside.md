The `v-click-outside` directive calls a function when something outside of the target element is clicked on. This is used internally by components like `v-menu` and `v-dialog`.

## Examples

### Options

#### Close conditional

Optionally provide a `closeConditional` handler that returns `true` or `false`. This function determines whether the outside click function is invoked or not.

<ExamplesExample file="v-click-outside/option-close-on-outside-click" />

#### Include

Optionally provide an `include` function in the `options` object that returns an array of `HTMLElement`s. This function determines which additional elements that the click must be outside of, for the handler to be called.
