# Typescript

Vuetify supports Typescript out of the box. This means that you can use Typescript in your Vuetify project without any additional configuration.

## Installation

To get started with a new project using Typescript, following the instructions in the [Getting Started](/getting-started/installation/) guide and select the Typescript option when prompted.

## Types

Vuetify provides types for all of its components and seamlessly integrates with Typescript. If you're using an IDE such as VSCode, with the [Vue - Official extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) and `<script lang="ts">`, you'll get automatic type checking and code completion.

## Custom components
