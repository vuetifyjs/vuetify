# Blueprints

Vuetify blueprints are a new way to pre-configure your entire application with a completely unique design system.

<PageFeatures />

<PromotedEntry />

## Usage

Blueprints are a collection of Vuetify configuration options that assign default values for components, colors, language, and more. Open your project's `vuetify.js` file and import the desired blueprint. The follow example demonstrates how to apply the [Material Design 1](#material-design-1) preset:

```js { resource=plugins/vuetify.js }
import { createVuetify } from 'vuetify'
import { md1 } from 'vuetify/blueprints'

export default createVuetify({
  blueprint: md1,
})
```

### White-label concept

While Vuetify is built under the guise of Google's [Material Design](https://material.io) specification, it is still flexible enough to be used as the foundation for any design system. By default, Vuetify components have no color and are **white-label** in nature. A white-label product is a product or service produced by one company that other companies rebrand to make it appear as if they had made it.
