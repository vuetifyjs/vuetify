# Alerts

The `v-alert` component is used to convey important information to the user through the use of contextual types, icons, and colors.

<PageFeatures />

## Usage

An alert is a [v-sheet](/components/sheets/) that specializes in getting the user's attention. While similar to [v-banner](/components/banners/) in functionality, `v-alert` is typically inline with content and used multiple times throughout an application.

<ExamplesUsage name="v-alert" />

## API

| Component | Description |
| - | - |
| [v-alert](/api/v-alert/) | Primary Component |
| [v-alert-title](/api/v-alert-title/) | Sub-component used to display the `v-alert` title. Wraps the `#title` slot |

## Anatomy

The recommended placement of elements inside of `v-alert` is:

* Place a `v-icon` on the far left
* Place `v-alert-title` to the right of the contextual icon
* Place textual content below the title
* Place closing actions to the far right

| Element / Area | Description |
| - | - |
| 1. Container | The Alert container holds all `v-alert` components |
| 2. Icon | An icon that correlates to the contextual state of the alert; **success, info, warning, error** |
| 3. Title | A heading with increased font-size |
| 4. Text | A content area for displaying text and other inline elements |
| 5. Close Icon (optional) | Used to hide the `v-alert` component |

## Guide

The `v-alert` component is a callout element designed to attract the attention of a user. Unlike [v-banner](/components/banners/), the `v-alert` component is intended to be used and re-used throughout your application. An alert's color is derived from its **type** property which corresponds to your application's contextual [theme colors](/features/theme/#custom-theme-colors) and [iconfont aliases](/features/icon-fonts/#creating-a-custom-icon-set).

### Props

In addition to the standard [v-sheet](/components/sheets/) properties such as elevation, dimension, and border-radius, the `v-alert` component supports **v-model**, **variants**, and **density**.

#### Content

The `v-alert` component supports simple content using the **title** and **text** props. This approach is best for strings that do not need custom styling.

The following code snippet is an example of a basic `v-alert` component only containing text:

```html
<v-alert text="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Commodi, ratione debitis quis est labore voluptatibus..."></v-alert>
```

Adding a title is as easy as defining its value. The next example adds a string title to accompany the content text:

<ExamplesExample file="v-alert/prop-content" />

Notice how the alert does not have a color or icon. This is defined using the **type** property.

#### Type

Alerts have 4 contextual states: **success**, **info**, **warning**, and **error**. Each state has a default _color_ and _icon_ associated with it. When a **type** is not provided, the `v-alert` component defaults to a greyish background.

With a basic alert rendered, add your choice of contextual type. The following example puts the `v-alert` component in a success state:

<ExamplesExample file="v-alert/prop-type" />

##### Type reference

| Type | Color | Icon alias | Icon |
| - | - | - | :---: |
| Success | **success** { .text-success } | $success | <v-icon icon="$success" /> |
| Info | **info** { .text-info } | $info | <v-icon icon="$info" /> |
| Warning | **warning** { .text-warning } | $warning | <v-icon icon="$warning" /> |
| Error | **error** { .text-error } | $error | <v-icon icon="$error" /> |

#### Color and icon

The **type** property acts as a shorthand for a **color** and **icon** combination, you can use both props individually to achieve the same effect. The following example produces the same result as using **type="success"** by defining a custom color and using the icon lookup table to get the globally defined success icon:

```html
<v-alert
  color="success"
  icon="$success"
  title="Alert title"
  text="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Commodi, ratione debitis quis est labore voluptatibus..."
></v-alert>
```

#### Density

The `v-alert` component has the ability to reduce its height in intervals using the density prop. This is useful when you need to reduce the vertical space a component needs. The following example reduces the vertical space by using **density="compact"**:

<ExamplesExample file="v-alert/prop-density" />

The **density** prop supports 3 levels of component height; **default**, **comfortable**, and **compact**.

#### Variants

The `v-alert` has 6 style variants, **elevated**, **flat**, **tonal**, **outlined**, **text**, and **plain**. By default, the `v-alert` component is **flat**; which means that it has a solid background and no box-shadow (elevation). The following example modifies the overall styling of the alert with a custom variant:

<ExamplesExample file="v-alert/prop-variant" />

#### Closable

The **closable** prop adds a [v-icon](/components/icons) on the far right, after the main content. This control hides the `v-alert` when clicked, setting it's internal model to **false**. Manually control the visibility of the alert by binding **v-model** or using **model-value**. The following example uses a dynamic model that shows and hides the `v-alert` component:

<ExamplesExample file="v-alert/prop-closable" />

The close icon automatically applies a default `aria-label` and is configurable by using the **close-label** prop or changing **close** value in your locale.

## Additional Examples

The following is a collection of `v-alert` examples that demonstrate how different the properties work in an application.

### Border color

The **border-color** prop removes the alert background in order to accent the **border** prop. If a **type** is set, it will use the type's default color. If no **color** or **type** is set, the color will default to the inverted color of the applied theme (black for light and white/gray for dark).

<ExamplesExample file="v-alert/prop-border-color" />

### Icon

The **icon** prop allows you to add an icon to the beginning of the alert component. If a **type** is provided, this will override the default type icon. Additionally, setting the **icon** prop to _false_ will remove the icon altogether.

<ExamplesExample file="v-alert/prop-icon" />

### Outlined

The **outlined** prop inverts the style of an alert, inheriting the currently applied **color**, applying it to the text and border, and making its background transparent.

<ExamplesExample file="v-alert/prop-outlined" />

## Accessibility

By default, `v-alert` components are assigned the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) role of [**alert**](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#alert) which denotes that the alert \"is a live region with important and usually time-sensitive information.\" When using the **closable** prop, the close icon will receive a corresponding `aria-label`. This value can be modified by changing either the **close-label** prop or globally through customizing the [Internationalization](/features/internationalization)'s default value for the _close_ property.
