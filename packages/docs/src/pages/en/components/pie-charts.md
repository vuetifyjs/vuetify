## Guide

`v-pie` does not have any opinionated way to use. You may start by providing an array of items (data) and then customize, hide or replace elements to make it behave as you wish to fit your project.

There are some notable features that are not common in other Vuetify components:

- each item is expected to have a `key` field (name can be changed with `item-key`)
- `tooltip` accept object and lets you customize transition, offset and the text. Notably, the `titleFormat` and `subtitleFormat` can be functions or simple string templates that support `[title]` and `[value]` macros.
- `animations` prop lets you control duration and easing

### Props

The `v-pie` supports various stylistic props to customize the appearance and hover transitions.

#### Size

Charts are more like drawings then regular HTML elements and their size needs to be controlled externally. `hover-scale` will reserve some space to enlarge segments on hover.

#### Palette

Colors can be conveniently passed to a dedicated `palette` prop.

<ExamplesExample file="v-pie/prop-palette" />

#### Legend position

The legend can be moved to any side or hidden entirely. With little effort you can also control legend's and tooltip's text.

<ExamplesExample file="v-pie/prop-legend" />

#### Item text overrides

Single item representation can be easily customized with string templates.

### Examples

The following are a collection of examples that demonstrate some more advanced capabilities of `v-pie` component.

#### Custom Legend

Legend does not need to be a list of chips. You can fully override it to match the expected design.

#### Overlay patterns

The following example demonstrates how to provide overlay patterns to support users with vision impairments.
