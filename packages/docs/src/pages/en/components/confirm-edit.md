## Guide

The `v-confirm-edit` component is an intuitive way to capture a model's changes before they are committed. This is useful when you want to prevent accidental changes or to allow the user to cancel their changes.

### Pickers

It's easy to integrate pickers into the `v-confirm-edit` component. This allows you to provide a more user-friendly experience when selecting dates, times, or colors.

<ExamplesExample file="v-confirm-edit/misc-date-picker" />

### Disable actions

You can control the disabled state of action buttons using **disabled** prop by either passing an array to disable targeted actions or a boolean value to disable all actions. If the **disabled** prop is not provided, the component will use internal logic to determine the disabled state.
