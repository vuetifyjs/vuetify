## API

| Component | Description |
| - | - |
| [v-app-bar](/api/v-app-bar/) | Primary Component |
| [v-app-bar-nav-icon](/api/v-app-bar-nav-icon/) | A customized [v-btn](/components/buttons/) component that uses a default *icon* value of **$menu** |
| [v-app-bar-title](/api/v-app-bar-title/) | An extension of `v-toolbar-title` that is used for scrolling techniques |

<ApiInline hide-links />

::: tip

The app-bar component works great in conjunction with a [v-navigation-drawer](/components/navigation-drawers) for providing site navigation in your application.

:::

## Anatomy

The recommended placement of elements inside of `v-app-bar` is:

- Place `v-app-bar-nav-icon` or other navigation items on the far left
- Place `v-app-bar-title` to the right of navigation
- Place contextual actions to the right of navigation
- Place overflow actions to the far right

| Element / Area | Description |
| - | - |
| 1. Container | The App Bar container holds all `v-app-bar` components |
| 2. App Bar Icon (optional) | A styled icon button component created that is often used to control the state of a `v-navigation drawer` |
| 3. Title (optional) | A heading with increased **font-size** |
| 4. Action items (optional) | Used to highlight certain actions not in the overflow menu |
| 5. Overflow menu (optional) | Place less often used action items into a hidden menu |

::: warning

When a `v-btn` with the `icon` prop is used inside of `v-toolbar` and `v-app-bar` they will automatically have their size increased and negative margin applied to ensure proper spacing according to the Material Design Specification. If you choose to wrap your buttons in any container, such as a `div`, you will need to apply negative margin to that container in order to properly align them.

## Examples

The following are a collection of examples that demonstrate more advanced and real world use of the `v-app-bar` component.

### Props

The `v-app-bar` component has a variety of props that allow you to customize its look and feel, density, scroll behavior, and more.

#### Scroll behavior

Available values:

- **hide**: The default slot area will shift up and hide as the user scrolls down. The extension slot remains visible.
- **fully-hide**: The entire app bar will hide as the user scrolls down.
- **collapse**: Shrink horizontally to a small bar in one corner.
- **elevate**: Add a drop shadow to the app bar when scrolling. Ignores `scroll-threshold`, will always be applied with any amount of scrolling.
- **fade-image**: Fade out the image as the user scrolls down.
- **inverted**: Has no effect on its own, but will reverse the behavior when combined with any other option.

The `scroll-threshold` prop is used to determine how far the user must scroll down (in pixels) before the behavior is applied.

A scroll listener is added to `window` by default, but can be changed to a custom element using the `scroll-target` prop.

#### Density

You can make **app-bar** dense. A dense app bar has lower height than regular one.

<ExamplesExample file="v-app-bar/prop-density" />

#### Images

`v-app-bar` can contain background images. You can set source via the `image` prop. If you need to customize the `v-img` properties, the app-bar provides you with an **image** slot.

<ExamplesExample file="v-app-bar/prop-image" />

#### Prominent

An `v-app-bar` with the `density="prominent"` prop can be used for longer titles, to house imagery, or to provide a stronger presence to the top app bar.
