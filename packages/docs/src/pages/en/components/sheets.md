## Guide

Often when building out a user interface, you will need to create a container for content and other custom components. The `v-sheet` component is a great way to do this. It provides a baseline for elevation, rounded corners, and color.

### Props

Some of the standard props that can be applied to the `v-sheet` component are listed below.

#### Elevation

The `v-sheet` component accepts a custom elevation between **0** and **24** (0 is default). The _elevation_ property modifies the `box-shadow` property. More information is located in the MD [Elevation Design Specification](https://material.io/design/environment/elevation.html).

<ExamplesExample file="v-sheet/prop-elevation" />

#### Rounded

The **rounded** prop adds a default `border-radius` of _4px_. By default, the `v-sheet` component has no border-radius. Customize the radius's size and location by providing a custom rounded value; e.g. a rounded value of _tr-xl l-pill_ equates to _rounded-tr-xl rounded-l-pill_. Additional information is on the [Border Radius](/styles/border-radius/) page.

#### Color

Sheets and components based on them can have different sizes and colors.

The `v-sheet` component accepts custom [Material Design Color](/styles/colors/) values such as `warning`, `amber darken-3`, and `deep-purple accent` â€” as well as _rgb_, _rgba_, and _hexadecimal_ values.
