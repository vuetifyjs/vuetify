# Locale providers

The locale provider allows you to provide specific default prop values to components in a section of your application

<entry />

## API

| Component | Description |
| - | - |
| [v-locale-provider](/api/v-locale-provider/) | Primary Component |

<api-inline hide-links />

## Examples

### Locale

The `v-locale-provider` expects a prop **locale** which looks the same as the **locale** object that you can pass to `createVuetify` when creating your application.
