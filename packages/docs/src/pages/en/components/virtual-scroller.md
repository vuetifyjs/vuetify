# Virtual scrollers

The `v-virtual-scroll` component displays a virtual, _infinite_ list. It supports dynamic height and scrolling vertically and is a good alternative to pagination.

| Element / Area | Description |
| - | - |
| 1. Container | The rendered content area from the provided **items** prop |

## Guide

The `v-virtual-scroll` allows you to display thousands of records on a single page without the performance hit of actually showing all of them at once. `v-virtual-scroll` is devoid of styling and pairs well with components such as [v-card](/components/cards/) to provide a better visual experience.

### Props

The `v-virtual-scroll` component has a small API mainly used to configure the root and item height.

#### Height

The `v-virtual-scroll` component does not have any initial height set on itself.

The following code snippet uses the **height** prop:

<ExamplesExample file="v-virtual-scroll/prop-height" />

Another way of making sure that the component has height is to place it inside an element with `display: flex`.

<ExamplesExample file="v-virtual-scroll/prop-height-parent" />

#### Item Height

For lists where the item height is static and uniform for all items, it's recommended that you define a specific **item-height**. This value is used for `v-virtual-scroll`'s calculations.

<ExamplesExample file="v-virtual-scroll/prop-item-height" />

If your items are not of a uniform size, omit the **item-height** prop to have `v-virtual-scroll` dynamically calculate each item.

<ExamplesExample file="v-virtual-scroll/prop-dynamic-item-height" />

### Examples

The following is a collection of `v-virtual-scroll` examples that demonstrate how different the properties work in an application.

#### User Directory

The v-virtual-scroll component can render an large amount of items by rendering only what it needs to fill the scrollerâ€™s viewport.

<ExamplesExample file="v-virtual-scroll/misc-user-directory" />
