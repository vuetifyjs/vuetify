## Installation

Labs components require a manual import and installation of the component.

```js { resource="src/plugins/vuetify.js" }
import { VCalendar } from 'vuetify/labs/VCalendar'

export default createVuetify({
  components: {
    VCalendar,
  },
})
```

## Usage

A calendar has a type and a value which determines what type of calendar is shown over what span of time. This shows the bare minimum configuration, an array of events with **title**, **start** and **end** properties. **end** is optional, it defaults to the **start**. If the **start** has a time it's considered a timed event and will be shown accordingly in the day views. An event can span multiple days and will be rendered accordingly.
