# Transitions

Smooth animations help make a UI feel great. Using Vue's transition system and re-usable functional components, you can easily control the motion of your application. Most components can have their transition altered through the **transition** prop.

## Create your own

You can use Vuetify's transition helper function to easily create your own custom transitions.

```js
import { createCssTransition } from 'vuetify/util/transitions';

createCssTransition('my-transition')
```

The argument passed to the **createCssTransition** function will be the name of the transition that you can hook into your style. This is an example of what `my-transition` looks like:

```scss
.my-transition {
  &-enter-active,
  &-leave-active {
    position: absolute;
    transition: 1s;
  }

  &-enter-from,
  &-leave-to {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
```

You can now use this custom transition in a few different ways.

### As a component

The **createCssTransition** function will return a component that you can use in your template.

<ExamplesExample file="transitions/create-css-transition-component" />

### As a prop

Many of Vuetifyâ€™s components contain a **transition** prop. You can send the name of your custom transition to the transition prop.

<ExamplesExample file="transitions/create-css-transition-prop" />
