    ssr: true,
  })

* **Is there support for Nuxt 3?** { #is-there-support-for-nuxt-3 }

  Yes, Vuetify 3 is compatible with Nuxt 3 but does not currently have a community Nuxt module.

* **What is Vuetify Labs?** { #what-is-vuetify-labs }

  Vuetify Labs is a collection of components that are still in development. They are not considered stable and may change at any time. They are not included in the default Vuetify installation and must be imported individually. See the [Labs](/labs/introduction/) page for more information.

* **Does Vuetify have Nightly Builds?** { #does-vuetify-have-nightly-builds }

  Yes, Vuetify has nightly builds. See the [Nightly Builds](/getting-started/installation/#nightly-builds) page for more information.

* **I found a bug, what should I do?** { #i-found-a-bug-what-should-i-do }

  Please create a new [issue](https://issues.vuetifyjs.com/) with our Issue Generator. Please make sure to check for existing issues before creating a new one.

* **Why did Vuetify 3 change `value` to `model-value`?**

  The `value` prop was changed in Vue 3 to support a new `v-model` syntax. See the official Vue docs for more information on [Component v-model](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/v-model.html).

* **Is Vuetify 3 compatible with `@vue/compat`?**

  Not directly, you have to set `configureCompat({ MODE: 3 })` globally and `MODE: 2` in each of your components that you want to run in compatibility mode. There will still be some incorrect warnings that can be ignored with the `-ATTR_FALSE_VALUE` filter in devtools.

* **Why don't elements exist in the DOM yet in `onMounted()`?** ([#19736](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/19736))

  Some vuetify components are asynchronous, so there is no guarantee that their children will be mounted immediately. Either wait for the target element itself to be mounted with `v-on:vue:mounted` or use `onMounted` in a separate component that only has plain elements between the `<template>` and your target element.
