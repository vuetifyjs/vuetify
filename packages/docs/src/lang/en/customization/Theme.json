  "headingText": "Easily change the colors of your application programmatically. Rebuild the default stylesheet and customize various aspects of the framework for your particular needs.",
  "lightAndDarkHeader": "## Light and Dark",
  "lightAndDarkText1": "Vuetify supports both **light** and **dark** variants of the Material Design spec. This designation starts at the root application component, `v-app` and is supported by majority of components. By default, your application will use the **light** theme, but this can be easily overwritten by adding the **dark** option in the theme service.",
  "lightAndDarkText2": "When you designate a component as light or dark, all of its children will inherit and apply the same unless otherwise specified. You can manually turn **dark** on and off by changing `this.$vuetify.theme.dark` to **true** or **false**.",
  "customizingHeader": "## Customizing",
  "customizingText1": "By default, Vuetify has a standard theme applied for all components.",
  "customizingText2": "This can be easily changed. Simply pass a **theme** property to the Vuetify constructor. You can choose to modify all or only some of the theme properties, with the remaining inheriting from the default.",
  "customizingText3": "You can also use the pre-defined material colors.",
  "customizingText3a": "By default, the theme service will use your application's primary color for **anchor** tags. You can override this by adding an anchor property to the theme:",
  "customizingText4": "Under the hood, Vuetify will generate css classes based upon these values that will be accessible in the DOM. These classes will follow the same markup as other helper classes, `primary` or `secondary--text` for example. If you supply an entire color object (as in `colors.purple` above), the lighten/darken variations will be used directly instead of being generated.",
  "customizingText5": "These values will also be made available on the instance **$vuetify** object under the **theme** property. This allows you to _dynamically_ modify your theme. Behind the scenes, Vuetify will regenerate and update your theme classes, seamlessly updating your application.",
  "optionHeader": "## Options",
  "optionText1": "Vuetify generates theme styles at run-time for SPA's and server side for SSR applications. The generated styles will be placed in a `<style>` tag with an **id** of **vuetify-theme-stylesheet**.",
  "optionHeader2": "### Minification",
  "optionText3": "The `minifyTheme` option allows you to provide a custom minification implementation. This helps to reduce the initial page size and is suggested to be paired with [`options.themeCache`](#caching). In this example we use the [minify-css-string](https://github.com/bentatum/minify-css-string) package to minify the *generated theme styles*.",
  "optionHeader3": "### Caching",
  "optionText4": "You have the option to pass a custom `themeCache` implementation. This allows you to skip the need to recalculate the theme object. Below is an example using the [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) property:",
  "cacheAlert": "The provided `themeCache` object **must** contain a `get` and `set` method. Use them for retrieving and setting the *generated css* string.",
  "optionText4a": "Caching can also be done through [lru-cache](https://github.com/isaacs/node-lru-cache). This is specifically useful for SSR (Server Side Rendered) applications.",
  "optionHeader4": "### Custom Properties",
  "optionText5": "Enabling `customProperties` will also generate a [css variable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) for each theme color, which you can then use in your components' `<style>` blocks.",
  "customPropertiesAlert": "Custom properties are not natively supported in Internet Explorer. Polyfills (with some limitations) are available: [https://github.com/nuxodin/ie11CustomProperties](https://github.com/nuxodin/ie11CustomProperties), [https://github.com/jhildenbiddle/css-vars-ponyfill](https://github.com/jhildenbiddle/css-vars-ponyfill).",
  "optionHeader5": "### CSP Nonce",
  "optionText6": "Pages with the `script-src` or `style-src` CSP rules enabled may require a **nonce** to be specified for embedded style tags.",

  "variantsSubheader": "### Custom theme variants",
  "variantsText1": "While Vuetify automatically generates _lighten_ and _darken_ variants for theme colors, you may want to control this yourself. Simply pass a theme object that contains the variants that you wish to modify. Anything not provided will still be generated for you.",
  "variantsText2": "You can now import your custom theme object and apply it to Vuetify",
  "variantsText3": "Below is a full list of the overwritable keys on the theme object:",
  "disableSubheader": "### Disable theme",
  "disableText1": "You can disable theme functionality by using the **disable** property with a value of **true**. This will prevent the creation of the Vuetify stylesheet.",
  "provideHeading1": "## Theme Provider",
  "provideText1": "The Vuetify theme system is propagated through the [provide](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#provide-inject) functionality in Vue. There may be situations in which you need to manually change the provided theme (dark or light).",
  "provideHeading2": "### Usage",
  "provideText2": "In this example, the bottom card inherits from the root of **$vuetify.theme.dark**.",
  "props": {
    "root": "Use the current value of `$vuetify.theme.dark` as opposed to the provided one."
