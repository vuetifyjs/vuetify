  "headerText": "Easily change the colors of your application programmatically. Rebuild the default stylesheet and customize various aspects of the framework for your particular needs.",
  "lightAndDarkHeader": "## Light and Dark",
  "lightAndDarkText1": "Vuetify supports both **light** and **dark** variants of the Material Design spec. This designation starts at the root application component, `v-app` and is supported by majority of components. By default, your application will use the **light** theme, but this can be easily overwritten by adding the **dark** option in the theme service.",
  "lightAndDarkText2": "When you designate a component as light or dark, all of its children will inherit and apply the same unless otherwise specified. You can manually turn **dark** on and off by changing `this.$vuetify.theme.dark` to **true** or **false**.",
  "customizingHeader": "## Customizing",
  "customizingText1": "By default, Vuetify has a standard theme applied for all components.",
  "customizingText2": "This can be easily changed. Simply pass a **theme** property to the `Vue.use` function. You can choose to modify all or only some of the theme properties, with the remaining inheriting from the default.",
  "customizingText3": "You can also use the pre-defined material colors.",
  "customizingText3a": "By default, the theme service will use your application's primary color for **anchor** tags. You can override this by adding an anchor property to the theme:",
  "customizingText4": "Under the hood, Vuetify will generate css classes based upon these values that will be accessible in the DOM. These classes will follow the same markup as other helper classes, `primary` or `secondary--text` for example. If you supply an entire color object (as in `colors.purple` above), the lighten/darken variations will be used directly instead of being generated.",
  "customizingText5": "These values will also be made available on the instance **$vuetify** object under the **theme** property. This allows you to _dynamically_ modify your theme. Behind the scenes, Vuetify will regenerate and update your theme classes, seamlessly updating your application.",
  "optionHeader": "## Options",
  "optionText1": "Vuetify generates theme styles at run-time for SPA's and server side for SSR applications. The generated styles will be placed in a `<style>` tag with the **id** of **vuetify-theme-stylesheet**.",
  "optionHeader2": "### Minification",
  "optionText3": "For SSR applications, you can pass a callback function to **$vuetify.options.minifyTheme** to reduce the initial page size. When using this option, it is recommended to also use **themeCache**.",
  "optionHeader3": "### Caching",
  "optionText4": "A custom caching object can be provided (works in tandem with **minifyTheme**) to increase SSR efficiency. The object must contain a **get** and a **set** method. Below is an example using [LRU cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lru-cache).",
  "optionHeader4": "### Custom Properties",
  "optionText5": "Enabling `customProperties` will also generate a css variable for each theme color, which you can then use in your components' `<style>` blocks.",
  "optionHeader5": "### CSP Nonce",
  "optionText6": "Pages with the `script-src` CSP rule enabled may require a **nonce** to be specified for embedded style tags. ",
  "themeGeneratorHeader": "## Theme generator",
  "themeGeneratorText1": "Discover and generate new color themes for your **Vuetify** applications using our [Theme Generator](https://theme-generator.vuetifyjs.com) tool.",
  "variantsSubheader": "### Custom theme variants",
  "variantsText1": "While Vuetify automatically generates _lighten_ and _darken_ variants for theme colors, you may want to control this yourself. Simply pass a theme object that contains the variants that you wish to modify. Anything not provided will still be generated for you.",
  "variantsText2": "You can now import your custom theme object and apply it to Vuetify",
  "variantsText3": "Below is a full list of the overwritable keys on the theme object:"
