It contains 5 types of media breakpoints that are used for targeting specific screen sizes or orientations. The props for grid components are actually classes that are derived from their defined properties. This allows you to easily specify these helper classes as props, while still providing the classes to be used anywhere.",

  "breakpointText3": "That's a lot of boilerplate to write. Even if you opt to use the built in [v-resize](/directives/resizing) directive, you are still going to have to define a resize method. With the **breakpoint** object you can completely skip this logic and get back to building your application.",
  "customizeThresholdsText1": "You can define your own breakpoint threshold pixel values, but it is currently a two-step process: 1. To update the styles you will have to override the `$grid-breakpoints` stylus variables (please see [**Modifying SASS variables**](/customization/theme/#modifying-sass-variables)). 2. To use the same values on the javascript side of things you must pass them during the application bootstrap like so:"
