  "heading": "# Icons",
  "headingText": "Vuetify comes bootstrapped with support for Material Design Icons, Material Icons, Font Awesome 4 and Font Awesome 5. By default, applications will default to use [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/).",
  "usageText1": "In order to change your font library, add the `iconfont` option during instantiation.",
  "usageText2": "Using a predefined option will prefill defaults based upon the selected preset. This will overwrite the defaults of components that have default **icon** values. For more information, view the default [icon preset values](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/tree/master/packages/vuetify/src/services/icons/presets).",
  "installHeader": "## Installing iconfonts",
  "installText1": "You are required to include the specified icon library (even if using default). This can be done by including a CDN link or importing the icon library into your application",
  "installMD": "### Install Material Icons",
  "installMDText1": "Installation is the same as the above. For projects without a build process, it is recommended to import the icons from CDN",
  "installMDText2": "Alternatively, it is possible to install locally using yarn or npm. Keep in mind that this is not an official google repository and may not receive updates",
  "installMDText3": "Once you have installed the package, import it into your main entry js file. This is typically the `main.js`, `index.js` or `app.js` located in your `src/` folder. If you are using an SSR application, you may have a `client.js` or `entry-client.js` file.",
  "installMDI": "### Install Material Design Icons",
  "installMDIText1": "This is the default icon font for Vuetify. You can include it through a CDN:",
  "installMDIText2": "Or as a local dependency:",
  "installMDISvg": "### Install Material Design Icons (JS SVG)",
  "installMDISvgText1": "Use the SVG Path's as designated in [@mdi/js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/js). This is the recommended installation when optimizing your application for production. You **ONLY** need to include this if you plan on using more than the default icons.",
  "installMDISvgText2": "Specify the **mdiSvg** iconfont:",
  "installMDISvgText3": "You can custom import only the icons you use granting a much smaller bundle size.",
  "installFA": "### Install Font Awesome 5 Icons",
  "installFAText1": "The easiest way to get started with **FontAwesome** is to use a cdn. Within the head of your main `index.html` place this snippet:",
  "installFAText2": "To install locally you can pull in the [Free](https://fontawesome.com/) version of **FontAwesome** using your preferred package manager:",
  "installFAText3": "Within your main entry point, simply import the package's **all.css**. If you are using a configured webpack project, you will need to setup support for `.css` files using the webpack [css loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader). If you are already using [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/), this is done for you automatically.",
  "installFA4": "### Install Font Awesome 4 Icons",
  "installFA4Text1": "Same as above. Installing FontAwesome through cdn is the easiest way to check it out within your project:",
  "installFA4Text2": "Installing FontAwesome**4** is the same as its newer version, just from a different repository. You will be targeting the `font-awesome` repo as opposed to `@fortawesome` one.",
  "installFA4Text3": "Don't forget, your project will need to recognize css. If you are using webpack, install and setup the [css loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader).",
  "installFASvg": "### Install Font Awesome SVG Icons",
  "installFASvgText1": "Add required dependencies.",
  "installFASvgText2": "Then add globally `font-awesome-icon` component and set `faSvg` as iconfont in Vuetify config.",
  "customIconsHeader": "## Using custom icons",
  "customIconsText1": "Let's say your application calls for a custom icon in a Vuetify component. Instead of creating a wrapper component or manually defining the specific icon each time a component appears, you can configure it at a global level.",
  "customIconsText2": "If you are using a icon library that does not have a preset, you can create a custom one.",
  "reusableHeader": "## Reusable custom icons",
  "reusableText1": "Vuetify will _automatically_ merge any icon strings provided into the pool of available presets. This allows you to create custom strings that can be utilized in your application by simply referencing the **global icons**.",
  "reusableText2": "This can help ensure your application is always using a specific icon given a provided string. Here are a few ways that you can use `<v-icon>` with this system.",
  "customComponentHeader": "## Custom components",
  "customComponentText1": "You can utilize the same icon strings in your own custom components. Any time **$vuetify.icons** (or shortcut **$**) is passed in through _v-text_, _v-html_ or as text, `<v-icon>` will look up that specified value. This allows you to create customized solutions that are easy to build and easy to manage.",
  "componentIconsHeader": "## Component icons",
  "componentIconsText1": "Instead of provided icon fonts presets you can use your own component icons. You also can switch icons that are used in Vuetify component with your own.",
  "componentIconsText2": "If you want your SVG icon to inherit colors and scale correctly - be sure add the following css to it:",
  "usingMissingMaterialIconsHeader": "## Using missing Material Icons",
  "usingMissingMaterialIconsText1": "Some material icons are missing by default. For example, `person` and `person_outline` are available, but `visibility_outline` isn't, while `visibility` is. To use missing material icons, include the font below (remove another material font if already registered).",
  "usingMissingMaterialIconsText2": "You can add your custom component. Let me assume it is **@/components/MaterialIcon.vue**.",
  "usingMissingMaterialIconsText3": "Then you need to register the exact material icons you want.",
  "usingMissingMaterialIconsText4": "Finally you can use the material icons like this.",
  "customFASvg": "### Custom Font Awesome Pro Icons",
  "customFASvgText1": "You can utilize component icons with Font Awesome Pro to select individual icon weights:"
