In those cases, the role of [**presentation**](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#presentation) should be used which denotes \"an element whose implicit native role semantics will not be mapped to the accessibility API.\" To override the default **separator** role in a `v-divider`, simply add a `role=\"presentation\"` prop to your component. In addition, `v-divider` components have an `aria-orientation=\"horizontal\"`. If `vertical=\"true\"`, then `aria-orientation=\"vertical\"` will be set automatically as well. If `role=\"presentation\"`, `aria-orientation=\"undefined\"`, it's default value."
