    "usage": {
      "desc": "The internal `v-form` component makes it easy to add validation to form inputs. All input components have a `rules` prop which takes an array of functions. These functions allow you to specify conditions in which the field is _valid_ or _invalid_. Whenever the value of an input is changed, each function in the array will receive the new value. If a function returns false or a string, validation has failed."

    "rules": {
      "heading": "### Creating rules",
      "desc": "Rules allow you to apply custom validation on all form components. These are validated sequentially and will display a **maximum** of 1 error at a time, so make sure you order your rules accordingly."

      "heading": "### Validation with submit & clear",
      "desc": "The `v-form` component has **three** functions that can be accessed by setting a _ref_ on the component. A ref allows us to access internal methods on a component, for example, `<v-form ref=\"form\">`. **this.$refs.form.validate()** will validate all inputs and return if they are all valid or not. **this.$refs.form.reset()** will clear all inputs and reset their validation errors. **this.$refs.form.resetValidation()** will only reset input validation and not alter their state."
