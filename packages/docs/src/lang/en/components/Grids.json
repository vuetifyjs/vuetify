  "headerText": "Vuetify comes with a 12 point grid system built using <kbd>flex-box</kbd>. The grid is used to create specific layouts within an application's content.  It contains 5 types of media breakpoints that are used for targeting specific screen sizes or orientations, **xs**, **sm**, **md**, **lg** and **xl**. These resolutions are defined below in the Viewport Breakpoints table and can be modified by customizing the [Breakpoint service](/customization/breakpoints).",
  "headerAlert1": "1.x grid system has been deprecated in favor of the 2.x grid system. Documentation for 1.x grids can be found in the [v1.5 docs](https://v15.vuetifyjs.com/framework/grid)",

  "usageList": [
    "`v-container` provides the ability to center and horizontally pad your site's contents. You can also use the **fluid** prop to fully extend the container across all viewport and device sizes. Maintains previous 1.x functionality in which props are passed through as classes on `v-container` allowing for the application of helper classes (such as `ma-#`/`pa-#`/`fill-height`) to easily be applied",
    "`v-row` is a wrapper component for `v-col`. It utilizes flex properties to control the layout and flow of its inner columns. It uses a standard gutter of **24px**. This can be reduced with the **dense** prop or removed completely with **no-gutters**. This is the 2.x replacement for `v-layout` in 1.x.",
    "`v-col` is a content holder that must be a direct child of `v-row`. This is the 2.x replacement for `v-flex` in 1.x."
