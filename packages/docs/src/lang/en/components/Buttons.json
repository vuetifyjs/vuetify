  "alert": "`v-btn` is the only component that behaves differently when using the **dark** prop. Normally components use the **dark** prop to denote that they have a dark colored background and need their text to be white. While this will work for `v-btn`, it is advised to only use the prop when the button **IS ON** a colored background due to the disabled state blending in with white backgrounds. If you need white text, simply add the **white--text** class.",
