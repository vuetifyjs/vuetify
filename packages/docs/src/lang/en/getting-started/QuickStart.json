  "vueCliHeader": "## Vue CLI 3 Install",
  "vueCliText1": "Vue CLI 3 is the next generation cli tool made to help you get started more easily than before. When you start your app with Vue CLI 3 you will also be able to get the official webpack updates and config changes, as well as Vuetify's updates without an arduous upgrade process.",
  "vueCliText2": "For information on how to use Vue CLI 3, visit the [official documentation](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/)",
  "vueCliText3": "**Tip**: If you already have **Vue CLI** installed, you can check if you are on the latest version by typing <kbd>vue --version</kbd> from your terminal.",
  "vueCliText4": "Once the cli is installed, you can generate a new project scaffold. Select the _default install_ unless you have specific packages that you need to include (e.g. _vuex_ or _vue-router_). This will create a new Vue project that's ready to go with your selected options.",
  "vueCliText5": "Now that you have an instantiated project, you can add the [Vuetify package](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vue-cli-plugin-vuetify) using the cli.",
  "vueCliText6": "This will provide you with a set of options for customizing your installation. The default preset has [a-la-carte](/customization/a-la-carte) already enabled for you.",

  "browserText": "Vuetify is a progressive framework that attempts to push web development to the next level. In order to best accomplish this task, some sacrifices had to be made in terms of support for older versions of Internet Explorer. This is not an exhaustive list of compatible browsers, but the main targeted ones.",
  "cdnHeader": "## CDN usage",
  "cdnText": "To test using Vuetify.js without installing a template from Vue CLI, copy the code below into your `index.html`. This will pull the latest version of Vue and Vuetify, allowing you to start playing with components. You can also use the [Vuetify starter](https://template.vuetifyjs.com) on codepen. While not recommended, if you need to utilize the cdn packages in a _production_ environment, it is recommended that you scope the versions of your assets. For more information on how to do this, navigate to the [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) website.",

  "existingText1": "To include Vuetify into an existing project, you must install its _npm package_. You can use either `npm` or `yarn` to accomplish this task. These are both package managers that allow you to control what resources are available in your application.",
  "existingText2": "For a detailed explanation of how to get `npm` running in your environment, check out the [official npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm). Alternatively, if you wish to use yarn, you can find more information on the [official yarn documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/). Once setup, you can run either command from the cli.",
  "existingText3": "Once Vuetify has been installed, create a folder within you `src` directory called `plugins`. Inside, add a **vuetify.js** file. This is where we will handle all of our bootstrapping and setup of Vuetify for your project.",
  "existingHeader3a": "### vuetify-loader installation",
  "existingText3a": "There are three ways in which you can install Vuetify. The first (and recommended) way is to utilize the [vuetify-loader](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify-loader) or what we call automatic **A-la-carte**. This will ensure that your application only uses the features and styles from Vuetify that are needed, significantly reducing your application's compiled size. Keep in mind, when importing from `vuetify/lib`, the necessary styles are _automatically_ imported for you.",
  "existingText3a1": "If there is a reason you are unable to utilize the **Vue CLI 3** package, you can manually install the **vuetify-loader** through your **vue.config.js** or **webpack** config. For more information on manual installation, navigate to the [A-la-carte page](/customization/a-la-carte).",
  "existingHeader3b": "### A-la-carte installation",

  "existingText3c": "The last method will import and setup **all** of Vuetify's features and styles. As stated above, it is still **recommended** that you utilize the **vuetify-loader** if at all possible. For this install, you will need to _manually_ import the Vuetify styles. This is also the process used when bootstrapping Vuetify through a browser as opposed to compiling. You can observe the browser installation in our [cdn quickstart](https://codepen.io/johnjleider/pen/bgJOrX).",
  "webpackHeader1": "### Webpack installation",
  "webpackText1": "When using webpack, you have the ability to setup your application with either of the above options (**Full** or **A-la-carte install**). However, you will need to configure add a webpack rule (or modify an existing one) for sass files. You can start by installing the necessary dependencies:",
  "webpackText2": "Once installed, locate your `webpack.config.js` file and copy the snippet below into the **rules** array. If you have an existing **sass** rule configured, you may need to apply some or all of the changes below. If you are you looking to utilize the **vuetify-loader** as well, you can find more information on setting it up with webpack on the [A-la-carte](/customization/a-la-carte#vueconfigjs-installation) page.",
  "existingHeader4": "## Bootstrapping the Vuetify Object",
  "existingText4": "Once you have setup your initial Vuetify options in your `src/plugins/vuetify.js` file, you must then pass that object into your main Vue instance options. This install process is similar to **vue-router** and **vuex**",
  "existingHeader5": "## Font Installation",
  "existingText5": "Vuetify uses the Google Roboto font per the [Material Design Specification](https://material.io/design/typography/the-type-system.html). The easiest way to use this font is by add a `<link>` element in the `<head>` of your main `index.html`.",

  "edgeHeader": "## Edge support",
  "edgeText1": "In order to support **modern mode** in vue-cli-3, `vuetify/lib` is not transpiled. You must tell vue-cli to transpile the `vuetify` package. This will be automatically handled in the future by vue-cli-plugin-vuetify pending a bug fix for vue-cli-3.",
  "ie11Header": "## IE11 & Safari 9 support",
  "ie11Text": "Vuetify utilizes features of ES2015/2017 that require the need to use polyfills for **Internet Explorer 11** and **Safari 9/10**. If you are using Vue CLI 3, this is done automatically for you. Otherwise, in your project directory, you can install `babel-polyfill`:",

  "ie11Text5": "Unfortunately Vue CLI 3 doesn't automatically bring IE11 compatibility in which you may encounter various errors (such as <i>Symbol is not defined</i>). To assist in resolving these errors you may need to manually add `transpileDependencies` parameter in `vue.config.js`",
  "ie11Text6": "Due to Internet Explorer's limited support for `<template>` tags, you must send fully compiled dom elements to the browser. This can be done by either building your Vue code in advance or by creating helper components to replace the dom elements. For instance, if sent directly to IE, this will fail:",
