  "headingText": "Unit tests are an important (and sometimes ignored) part of developing applications. They help us secure our processes and work flows, ensuring that the most critical parts of our projects are protected from accidental mistakes or oversights in our development. Because of this, Vue has its own testing utility called [vue-test-utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/). It provides useful features for interacting with Vue components and works with many popular test runners.",

This has the potential in some applications to generate a warning **$attrs** or **$listeners** is read-only.

  "setupText1": "In order to properly utilize Typescript, Vuetify components extend the Vue object. This has the potential to [cause issues](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/4068) as noted in the above alert. Instead of using a [localVue instance](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/api/options.html#localvue) we must instead install Vuetify globally in the unit tests setup file. This can vary between test runners. Make sure to reference the appropriate documentation on setup files.",
