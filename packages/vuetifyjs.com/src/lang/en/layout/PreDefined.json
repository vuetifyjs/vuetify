  "markupHeader": "## Default application markup",
  "markupText": "This is an example of the default application markup for Vuetify. You can place your layout elements anywhere, as long as you apply the **app** property. The key component in all of this is the `v-content` element. This will be dynamically sized depending upon the structure of your designated **app** components. This allows you to create extremely customized solutions.",
  "appHeader": "## All about _app_",
  "appText": "In Vuetify, the `v-app` component and the **app** help bootstrap your application with the proper sizing around `v-content`. This allows you to create truly unique interfaces without the hassle of managing your layout. The `v-app` component is **REQUIRED** for all applications. This is the mount point for many of Vuetify's components and functionality.",
  "alert1": "In order for your application to work properly, you **must** wrap it in a `v-app` component. This component is required for determining grid breakpoints for the layout. This can exist **anywhere** inside the body, but must be the parent of **ALL** Vuetify components.",
  "alert2": "Applying the **app** prop automatically applies position: **fixed** to the layout element. If your application calls for an _absolute_ element, you can overwrite this functionality using the **absolute** prop."
