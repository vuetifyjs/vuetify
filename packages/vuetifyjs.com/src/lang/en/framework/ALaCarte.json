  "header": "# Overview",
  "headerText": "Being a component framework, Vuetify will always grow horizontally. Depending on your project, a small **package size** may be a requirement. The A la carte system enables you to pick and choose which components to import, drastically _lowering_ your build size.",
  "header2": "# Example",
  "headerText2": "For a pre-built project demonstrating single component imports, install the **a-la-carte** template from the cli, using the command `vue init vuetifyjs/a-la-carte`. Some of our other templates also include options for enabling a-la-carte components. More information is located in the [Quick start guide](/getting-started/quick-start).",
  "importHeader": "## Importing components",
  "webpackVersionWarning": "Tree shaking only works with webpack 4 in production mode",
  "importText1": "Vuetify v1.3 brings support for tree-shaking with webpack. Simply import your components from `'vuetify/lib'`",
  "optionsDirectivesNotice": "The options object that you pass as the second argument to `Vue.use` can also include both a _directives_ and a _transitions_ property.",
  "importText2": "You can also import components in .vue files, as seen below. When doing so it's important that you import all named exports, and then destructure them in components. Otherwise child components such as `v-card-text` or `v-expansion-panel-content` will not be available.",
  "styleHeader": "## Required styles",
  "styleText1": "To obtain all the required styles, we need to import them in stylus. In order for webpack to handle this, you will need to install `stylus` and the `stylus-loader` from **npm**.",
  "stylusDetailNotice": "For a more detailed explanation on how to setup your application to handle stylus, please navigate to the [theme page](/style/theme#stylus-guide).",
  "styleText2": "Now you will need to require the stylus from the entry point of your application. This is the same place where you're importing Vue and Vuetify (usually `main.js` or `app.js`). Keep in mind, requiring this in your main `App.vue` can cause slow load times as it is re-processed when you make updates.",
  "loaderHeader": "## vuetify-loader",
  "loaderText1": "Keeping track of all the components you're using can be a real chore, so we wrote a webpack loader to help you. [**vuetify-loader**](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify-loader) will automatically import all the vuetify components you use, where you use them.\nThis will also make code-splitting more effective, as webpack will only load the components required for that chunk to be displayed.",
  "loaderText2": "Now any Vuetify component used in a template will be automatically added to an in-component import like above.",
  "loaderLimitationsHeader": "## Limitations",
  "loaderLimitationsText1": "When using the `vuetify-loader`, there are a few secnarios which will require manual importing of components.",
  "loaderLimitationsDynamicHeader": "## Dynamic components",
  "loaderLimitationsDynamicText1": "`v-data-iterator` can use any component via the **content-tag** prop. This component must be registered [globally](#global-import):",
  "loaderLimitationsDynamicText2": "Dynamic components used with `<component :is=\"\">` can be registered [locally](#local-import):",
  "loaderLimitationsFunctionalHeader": "## Functional components",
  "loaderLimitationsFunctionalText1": "Functional components are inlined at runtime by vue, and cannot have a `components` property in their options. Any vuetify components used in a custom functional component must either be registered globally (recommended), or locally whereever the custom component is used.",
  "loaderLimitationsPugHeader": "## Pre-processors (pug, HAML)",
  "loaderLimitationsPugText1": "Vuetify-loader currently cannot parse non-html templates such as pug. Anything used in these templates must be imported manually as above."
