  "structureText2": "The **Build** folder contains all of the webpack specific build configurations for your project. **Src** is where all the development project files reside. Notice that the Webpack-SSR template is out-of-the-box configured to use [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/), [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/intro.html), and the [Vue Server Renderer](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/ssr.html). This will allow you to make simple or complex applications that are not only fast/efficient, but **SEO** friendly.",

  "applicationText1": "Navigate to the **src** folder and open up <code>App.vue</code>. Vuetify is a semantic-focused framework. The code you write should be easy to remember, and easy to manage. To do this, one of the main components of Vuetify is <code>v-app</code>. This component allows you to define your application layout. This is used in conjunction with <code>v-toolbar</code>, <code>v-navigation-drawer</code>, and <code>v-footer</code>.",
  "applicationText2": "The markup below tells the application that you have a <code>toolbar</code> and <code>footer</code>. Once defined, the content area will be resized to accommodate.

  "routingText1": "The Webpack-SSR template uses the official Vue Router for controlling application flow. Located in <code>/src/router/index.js</code>, all of your application routes and route logic will be defined here. Inside you will also see a function that allows you to setup dynamically imported pages. This is not required, however, it will help break up your application and only load views that are needed, clearing up space in your eventual bundle output.",
  "routingText2": "These routes can be accessed by creating a link to the specified path, or by using Vue Router's `<router-link>` component. For more information, review the official Vue Router [documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/en/). The default function assumes you are placing views in the <kbd>/pages</kbd> folder containing **View** on the end of the file. Example <code>HomeView.vue</code>.",
  "stateControlHeader": "State control",
  "stateControlText1": "State control is managed by the official Vuex library. This Vue plugin follows Facebook's Reflux design pattern. Navigate to <code>/store/index.js</code>. By default, Vuex is setup to prefetch data for the store before your page is initially rendered. To hook into this functionality, create a <code>preFetch</code> method on your view component.",

  "metaDataHeader": "Meta data",
  "metaDataText": "In order to ensure that page specific meta data is viewable when your pages are crawled, you can define your applications page specific information in <code>router/meta.json</code>.

  "redirectsHeader": "Redirects",
  "redirectsText": "As applications evolve, routes change. If you want to maintain the authority already garnered from bots that index your page, it is best to assign a 301 redirect to the new location.
