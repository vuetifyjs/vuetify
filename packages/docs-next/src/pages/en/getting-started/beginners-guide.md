# Beginner's Guide

The purpose of the Vuetify Beginner's Guide is to provide a comprehensive and diverse approach to welcoming beginner to intermediate level web developers into the Vuetify Ecosystem.

We aim to accomplish this by having a broad variety of contributors creating content including (but not limited to):

* Blog Posts covering Vuetify specific and ecosystem topics
* Tutorials that teach how to use Vuetify effectively
* A glossary that covers essential terms with examples as needed

---
 ### Disclaimer:
 All content is reviewed by the Vuetify Core Team as well as Webdev beginners. We encourage feedback if further clarification, or a deeper dive into any and all concepts presented within this guide.

 If you would like to contribute to the Beginner's Guide, come chat with us in the [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/s93b7Fv).
